# CPBoy

CPBoy is a work in progress DMG GameBoy emulator for the fx-CP400. It based on the [Peanut-GB emulator by deltabeard](https://github.com/deltabeard/Peanut-GB).

Since the CAS has a rather slow processor, a high speed emulator core is mandatory to run emulation at an acceptable speed. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the emulation suffers a bit, which causes some games to be unplayable or have bugs. 


## Getting Started

You will need to have the [Hollyhock-2 CFW](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/) installed. After that just copy the most recent CPBoy.hkk from the releases tab into the root directory of your calculator. 

To load your Gameboy ROM, create a directory named "roms" and copy it to that directory on your calculator. The program should automatically detect the roms and create a selection menu.


## Controls

| Calculator key | GB key |
| -------------- | ------ |
| EXE						 | A      |
| +   					 | B      |
| SHIFT 				 | SELECT |
| CLEAR					 | START  |
| UP	 					 | UP		  |
| DOWN					 | DOWN	  |
| LEFT					 | LEFT	  |
| RIGHT					 | RIGHT  |

**MISC:**
 - (-): Exit emulator
 - KEYBOARD: Toggle frameskipping (When enabled, only render every second frame, which speeds up the emulator a bit but lowers its FPS)
 - BACKSPACE: Enable Interlacing (When enabled, only render every second line and switch every frame, which speeds up the emulator a bit but makes visuals worse)


## Building

If you want to build the emulator from source you will need the [Hollyhock-2 SDK](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/). Then, run ´make hhk´ in your terminal to build it. Make sure to build the .hhk file and not the .bin file because the .bin file causes the emulator to freeze and makes the CPU of the calculator behave weirdly (I have absolutely no idea why that happens).
